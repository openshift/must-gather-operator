# username: the user name for redhat case management system
# password: the password for redhat case management system
# caseid: the case id to upload to
# must_gather_output: the directory in which the must gather agents have collected the information
# must_gather_upload: a workspace directory that can be used as stage to zip and upload the must gather compressed file
# must_gather_target: where to send the file. By default it goes to Red Hat's sFTP server.
